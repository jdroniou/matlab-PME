Codes for approximating the porous medium equation with several numerical schemes.

* HMM-pme: Hybrid Mimetic Mixed method
* MLP1-pme: Mass-Lumping P1 finite elements

These codes are companion to the article "The gradient discretisation method for slow and fast diffusion porous media equations", J. Droniou and K. N. Le, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01785

Usage of these codes is permitted, but any resulting scientific publication should cite this paper.
